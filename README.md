# AI Content Podcaster

## Overview
Create an innovative mobile application that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform static documents into engaging podcast-style conversations between two AI-generated voices. This advanced-level challenge focuses on implementing sophisticated text analysis, content comprehension, and natural-sounding speech synthesis to make learning from documents more accessible, entertaining, and effective.

## Goal
Build a mobile application that allows users to upload text, PDF, or DOCX files about any topic and automatically generates an engaging, conversational podcast featuring two distinct AI voices discussing the content in various interactive formats (debate, collaboration, explanation, etc.), making complex information more digestible and entertaining.

## Required Features
- **Document upload**: Support uploading and processing of text, PDF, and DOCX files with proper extraction of formatted content
- **Content analysis**: Implement NLP to analyze document structure, key topics, arguments, and information hierarchy
- **Conversation generation**: Utilize LLMs to transform document content into natural-sounding dialogues between two distinct personas
- **Conversation styles**: Offer multiple conversation formats including:
  - Collaborative explanation (two voices helping each other understand)
  - Point/counterpoint debate on main ideas
  - Teacher/student format with questions and explanations
  - Expert interview simulation
- **Voice synthesis**: Integrate text-to-speech technology to create distinct, natural-sounding voices with appropriate intonation and pacing
- **Podcast controls**: Provide standard audio playback controls with additional features like bookmarking important points and adjustable playback speed
- **Content summarization**: Generate episode notes and key takeaways from the conversation
- **Sharing capabilities**: Allow export of generated podcasts as audio files with transcripts
- **Library management**: Organize created podcasts with search and filter functionality

## Technical Requirements
- Process and analyze documents up to 50 pages within reasonable time (under 2 minutes)
- Ensure generated conversations maintain factual accuracy to the original document
- Create natural-sounding dialogue with appropriate transitions, questions, and responses
- Implement efficient on-device processing for shorter documents with cloud processing option for longer texts
- Support multiple languages for both document analysis and speech synthesis
- Ensure proper handling of technical terminology, citations, and specialized content
- Optimize audio quality for clarity while maintaining reasonable file sizes

## Deliverables
- GitHub repository with complete source code
- README with setup instructions and feature overview
- 3 ~ 10 screenshots showcasing different app states
- Audio samples demonstrating various conversation styles
- Description of technical decisions and challenges overcome
- Implementation notes on NLP and LLM approaches
- Performance metrics for document processing and conversation generation
- (Optional) Link to a YouTube video for a short demo (30 seconds ~ 2 minutes)

## Bonus Ideas (Optional)
- User-defined voice characteristics and personalities
- Multi-voice conversations with more than two participants
- Integration with popular podcast platforms for direct publishing
- Interactive mode where users can ask questions about the content and get responses from the AI voices
- Content expansion where AI voices bring in relevant external information not contained in the original document
- Emotional tone detection and appropriate vocal expression
- Custom intro/outro music and professional podcast formatting
- Topic segmentation with chapter markers in longer documents
- Multilingual conversation mode that can explain concepts in different languages
- Real-time fact-checking against reliable sources during conversation generation
